# distributed-sorting

Implementations to sort integers distributed across a set of processors using Open MPI.

 1. **Count Sort**
	- Reccomended for a fixed range of integers.  
 2. **Hypercube based quick sort**
	- Classicial quick sort algorithm adapted to a distributed setting by taking advantage of the "divide and conquer " nature of the problem and sorting the data as a hypercube.
